### Alternative Recommendation

**Secondary Choice: Concept 2 - Support Constellation**

If the Family Unity Ring is deemed too abstract or if a more tech-forward identity is desired, the Support Constellation offers:
- Stronger visualization of the platform's network functionality
- More dynamic, modern aesthetic
- Better suited for animated applications
- Appeals to tech-savvy users

However, it may feel less warm and emotionally resonant than the Family Unity Ring, which is critical for the caregiving context.

### Concepts to Avoid

**Not Recommended:**
- **Concept 3 (Protective Embrace):** While emotionally powerful, the hand imagery may be too literal and could limit versatility at small sizes
- **Concept 4 (Unified Path):** The horizontal orientation creates challenges for square applications and may feel too directional/prescriptive

## Next Steps

1. **Stakeholder Review:** Present this specification document for feedback and approval
2. **Concept Refinement:** Make any requested adjustments to the recommended concept
3. **Final Design Development:** Create production-ready logo files in all required formats
4. **Brand Guidelines:** Develop comprehensive brand guidelines document
5. **Implementation:** Roll out logo across all touchpoints per implementation priority
