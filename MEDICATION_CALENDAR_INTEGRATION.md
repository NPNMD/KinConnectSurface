## Integration Points

### 1. Calendar System Integration

The medication calendar integrates seamlessly with the existing medical calendar system:

- **Event Creation:** Medication events are created as `MedicalEvent` objects with type `medication_reminder`
- **Calendar Views:** Medication events appear in all calendar views (month, week, day, list)
- **Event Management:** Standard calendar operations (edit, delete, reschedule) work with medication events
- **Conflict Detection:** Medication events participate in calendar conflict detection
- **Family Access:** Medication events respect family access permissions and visibility rules

### 2. Notification System Integration

Leverages the existing notification infrastructure:

- **Multi-Channel Delivery:** Uses email, SMS, and push notification services
- **Family Notifications:** Integrates with family notification routing
- **Scheduling:** Uses the notification scheduler for reminder delivery
- **Templates:** Utilizes notification templates for consistent messaging

### 3. Medication Management Integration

Connects with the existing medication management system:

- **Medication Data:** Links schedules to existing medication records
- **Drug Information:** Inherits medication details, instructions, and warnings
- **Prescription Management:** Coordinates with prescription tracking and refill reminders
- **Healthcare Provider Integration:** Connects with provider information for medication management

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Medication Schedule

```typescript
const scheduleData: NewMedicationSchedule = {
  medicationId: 'med_123',
  patientId: 'patient_456',
  frequency: 'twice_daily',
  times: ['08:00', '20:00'],
  startDate: new Date(),
  isIndefinite: true,
  dosageAmount: '1 tablet',
  instructions: 'Take with food',
  generateCalendarEvents: true,
  reminderMinutesBefore: [15, 5],
  isActive: true
};

const result = await medicationCalendarApi.createMedicationSchedule(scheduleData);
```

### Marking Medication as Taken

```typescript
const result = await medicationCalendarApi.markMedicationTaken(
  eventId,
  new Date(), // taken at
  'Took with breakfast' // optional notes
);
```

### Getting Adherence Data

```typescript
const adherence = await medicationCalendarApi.getMedicationAdherence({
  startDate: new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 30 days ago
  endDate: new Date()
});
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Notification settings
MEDICATION_REMINDER_ENABLED=true
MEDICATION_REMINDER_ADVANCE_DAYS=30

# Adherence tracking
ADHERENCE_CALCULATION_ENABLED=true
ADHERENCE_POOR_THRESHOLD=80

# Calendar integration
CALENDAR_EVENT_GENERATION=true
CALENDAR_CONFLICT_DETECTION=true
```

### Default Settings

```typescript
const DEFAULT_REMINDER_TIMES = [15, 5]; // minutes before dose
const DEFAULT_ADHERENCE_THRESHOLD = 80; // percentage
const DEFAULT_EVENT_GENERATION_DAYS = 30; // days ahead
const ADHERENCE_CALCULATION_WINDOW = 30; // days for calculations
```

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection

- **HIPAA Compliance:** All medication data is encrypted and access-controlled
- **Family Permissions:** Medication visibility respects family access permissions
- **Audit Logging:** All medication actions are logged for compliance
- **Data Retention:** Adherence data is retained according to healthcare regulations

### Access Control

- **Patient Ownership:** Patients own their medication schedules and data
- **Family Access:** Family members can view/manage based on granted permissions
- **Healthcare Provider Access:** Providers can view adherence data with patient consent
- **Emergency Access:** Emergency contacts have limited access during emergencies

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

- **Batch Event Generation:** Creates multiple calendar events in batches
- **Caching:** Caches frequently accessed medication and schedule data
- **Lazy Loading:** Loads adherence data on demand
- **Database Indexing:** Optimized queries for medication events and schedules

### Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Service can be scaled across multiple instances
- **Database Optimization:** Efficient queries and proper indexing
- **Background Processing:** Event generation runs in background jobs
- **Rate Limiting:** API endpoints have appropriate rate limits

## Monitoring and Alerts

### System Monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Events Not Generating**
   - Check medication schedule is active and not paused
   - Verify `generateCalendarEvents` is enabled
   - Ensure start date is not in the past
   - Check for service errors in logs

2. **Reminders Not Delivered**
   - Verify notification preferences are configured
